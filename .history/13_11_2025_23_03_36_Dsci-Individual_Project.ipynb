    "In order to answer this question we will need to wrangle our data to figure out how many users were online on a specific day at a specific time. Then we need to use that data to identify trends and group data together, for example if day of the week matters, or if month matters. After that we would run a regression of player count onto date and time and produce a confidence interval around our regression. Then we can use the upper limit of that confidence interval to know how many liscences to have ready for any given day and time. We would likely need to assume that month to month does not change the demand and only group by day of the week and time, this is due to our limited dataset. We would also want to use a kknn regression model instead of linear because the small changes in day or time might result in extremely large spikes or drops to player count(Ex. 4-5 pm with people off of work, Thursday vs Friday with people not having work to do Friday night). A linear regression would be too smooth and not account for these extreme differences. "
